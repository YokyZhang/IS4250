(a). Odds of having diabetic complications among good diabetic control =
3/7 Odds of having diabetic complications among poor diabetic control =
4/2 Therefore, Odds Ratio = (3/7)/(4/2) = 3/14, which suggests that
there is difference in complication rates between patients with good
diabetic control and those with poor control

(b). The Fisher's exact test is used here to analyse the relationship
between the two categorical variables in this contingency table.

    Convictions <-
      matrix(c(3, 4, 7, 2),
             nrow = 2,
             dimnames =
               list(c("Good", "Poor"),
                    c("Present", "Absent")))
    Convictions

    ##      Present Absent
    ## Good       3      7
    ## Poor       4      2

    fisher.test(Convictions, alternative = "two.sided")

    ## 
    ##  Fisher's Exact Test for Count Data
    ## 
    ## data:  Convictions
    ## p-value = 0.3024
    ## alternative hypothesis: true odds ratio is not equal to 1
    ## 95 percent confidence interval:
    ##  0.0137305 2.7634624
    ## sample estimates:
    ## odds ratio 
    ##  0.2384682

The result P-Value = 0.3024, suggesting that the difference between the
two rates is not statistically significant on the 95% confidence
interval.

(c). The reason is that the chi-square test only calculates an
approximate P value, while Fisher's test always gives the exact P value.
Chi-square test assumes that each cell has an expected frequency of five
or more, but the Fisher's exact test has no such assumption and can be
used regardless of how small the expected frequency is.
