```{r}
library(foreign)
library(ggplot2)
cty = read.spss("/Users/Yoky/NUS/Year4_Sem2/IS4250/Tutorial/5/country122.sav", to.data.frame=TRUE)
```

```{r}
fit1 <- lm(lifeexpf ~ birthrat, data=cty)
summary(fit1)

p <- ggplot(cty, aes(x=lifeexpf, y=birthrat))
p <- p + geom_point()
p <- p + geom_smooth(method = "lm", colour = "red")
plot(p)
```
The relationship between lifeexpf and birthrat is statistically significant on a 99.9% confidence level.
Lifeexpf is expected to decrease by 0.74471 on average as birthrat increses by one.

```{r}
predict(fit1, data.frame(birthrat=25))
```
Lifeexpf is expected to be 70.9711 on average when birthrat is 25 provided that other economic variables are similar.

```{r}
fit2 <- lm(lifeexpf ~ gdp + urban + hospbed + docs + radio, data=cty)
summary(fit2)
```
